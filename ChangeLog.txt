    ~ if PEM format public keys are used more than one may be included in the
      pinning file by concatenation to create a pin set instead of just the one
    ~ as a convenience, certificate(s) may be passed in place of or in addition
      to public key(s) and their public key will be automatically extracted and
      used as though it had been passed instead.

* GnuPG 1.4.18
  - added launchd GPG_AGENT_INFO compatibility patch
    ~ makes the trailing ":pid:protocol" part of GPG_AGENT_INFO optional


-----------------------------------------
Git 2.1.4 Installer - released 2015-01-02
-----------------------------------------

* Git v2.1.4
  - with backport of config file a+x fix
  - with backport of reflog reading fix
  - with backport of git-imap-send via libcurl
  - with backport of Tcl 8.4 git-gui fix
  - with git-send-email via libcurl
  - with OS X native translation support
  
* cURL/libcURL 7.38
  - with backport of SSLv3 is off by default from 7.39
  - with backport of IPv6 scope name parsing fix from 7.40
  - with much improved darwinssl SecureTransport backend
    ~ CURLOPT_CAINFO/--cacert, CURLOPT_SSLCERT/--cert and CURLOPT_SSLKEY/--key
      arguments are handled just like the OpenSSL backend and expect the same
      format certificates/private keys -- no more .p12!
    ~ library is OS X version agnostic and automatically adapts at runtime so
      when run on OS X 10.8 or later it automatically supports TLS 1.2.
    ~ certificate diagnostic output is much improved showing the entire
      certificate chain when the verbose option is set.

  - WITHOUT USB smartcard support

* libidn 1.29
