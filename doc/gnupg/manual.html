>GnuPG is a tool for secure communication.
This chapter is a quick-start guide that covers the core functionality
of GnuPG.
This includes keypair creation, exchanging and verifying keys, encrypting
and decrypting documents, and authenticating documents with digital
signatures.
It does not explain in detail the concepts behind public-key cryptography,
encryption, and digital signatures.
This is covered in Chapter <A
HREF="#CONCEPTS"
>2</A
>.
It also does not explain how to use GnuPG wisely.
This is covered in Chapters <A
HREF="#MANAGEMENT"
>3</A
> and 
<A
HREF="#WISE"
>4</A
>.</P
><P
>GnuPG uses public-key cryptography so that users may communicate securely.
In a public-key system, each user has a pair of keys consisting of
a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>private key</I
> and a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>public key</I
>.
A user's private key is kept secret; it need never be revealed.
The public key may be given to anyone with whom the user wants to
communicate.
GnuPG uses a somewhat more sophisticated scheme in which a user has
a primary keypair and then zero or more additional subordinate keypairs.
The primary and subordinate keypairs are bundled to facilitate key
management and the bundle can often be considered simply as one keypair.</P

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions. See the file COPYING for details.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (4) ElGamal (sign and encrypt)
Your selection?</PRE
>


GnuPG is able to create several different types of keypairs, but a primary
key must be capable of making signatures.
There are therefore only three options.
Option 1 actually creates two keypairs.
A DSA keypair is the primary keypair usable only for making signatures.
An ElGamal subordinate keypair is also created for encryption. 
Option 2 is similar but creates only a DSA keypair.
Option 4<A
NAME="AEN34"
HREF="#FTN.AEN34"
>[1]</A
> creates a single ElGamal 
keypair usable for both making signatures and performing encryption.
In all cases it is possible to later add additional subkeys for encryption
and signing.
For most users the default option is fine.</P
><P
>You must also choose a key size.
The size of a DSA key must be between 512 and 1024 bits, and an ElGamal
key may be of any size.
GnuPG, however, requires that keys be no smaller than 768 bits.
Therefore, if Option 1 was chosen and you choose a keysize larger than
1024 bits, the ElGamal key will have the requested size, but the DSA
key will be 1024 bits.

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>About to generate a new ELG-E keypair.
              minimum keysize is  768 bits
              default keysize is 1024 bits
    highest suggested keysize is 2048 bits
What keysize do you want? (1024)</PRE
>

The longer the key the more secure it is against brute-force attacks,
but for almost all purposes the default keysize is adequate since
it would be cheaper to circumvent the encryption than try to break it.
Also, encryption and decryption will be slower as the
key size is increased, and a larger keysize may affect signature length.
Once selected, the keysize can never be changed.</P
><P
>Finally, you must choose an expiration date.
If Option 1 was chosen, the expiration date will be used for both the
ElGamal and DSA keypairs.

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      &lt;n&#62;  = key expires in n days
      &lt;n&#62;w = key expires in n weeks
      &lt;n&#62;m = key expires in n months
      &lt;n&#62;y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) </PRE
>

For most users a key that does not expire is adequate.
The expiration time should be chosen with care, however,
since although it is possible to change the expiration date after the key
is created, it may be difficult to communicate a change
to users who have your public key.</P
><P
>You must provide a user ID in addition to the key parameters.
The user ID is used to associate the key being created with a real
person.

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>You need a User-ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user id
from Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) &lt;heinrichh@duesseldorf.de&#62;"

Real name: </PRE
>

Only one user ID is created when a key is created, but it is possible
to create additional user IDs if you want to use the key in two or
more contexts, e.g., as an employee at work and a political activist
on the side.
A user ID should be created carefully since it cannot be edited after
it is created.</P
><P
>GnuPG needs a passphrase to protect the primary and subordinate 
private keys that you keep in your possession.

<PRE
CLASS="SCREEN"
>You need a Passphrase to protect your private key.    

Enter passphrase: </PRE
>

There is no limit on the length of a passphrase, and it should be
carefully chosen.
From the perspective of security, the passphrase to unlock the private
key is one of the weakest points in GnuPG (and other public-key 
encryption systems as well) since it is the only protection you 
have if another individual gets your private key.
Ideally, the passphrase should not use words from a dictionary and
should mix the case of alphabetic characters as well as use 
non-alphabetic characters.
A good passphrase is crucial to the secure use of GnuPG.</P

>Generating a revocation certificate</A
></H2
><P
>After your keypair is created you should immediately generate a revocation
certificate for the primary public key using the option
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--gen-revoke</TT
>.
If you forget your passphrase or if your private key is compromised 
or lost, this revocation certificate may be published to notify others
that the public key should no longer be used.
A revoked public key can still be used to verify signatures made
by you in the past, but it cannot be used to encrypt future messages
to you.
It also does not affect your ability to decrypt messages sent to
you in the past if you still do have access to the private key.

>Once a key is imported it should be validated.
GnuPG uses a powerful and flexible trust model that does not require
you to personally validate each key you import.
Some keys may need to be personally validated, however.
A key is validated by verifying the key's fingerprint and then signing
the key to certify it as a valid key.
A key's fingerprint can be quickly viewed with the
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"

A key's fingerprint is verified with the key's owner.
This may be done in person or over the phone or through any other means
as long as you can guarantee that you are communicating with the key's
true owner.
If the fingerprint you get is the same as the fingerprint the key's
owner gets, then you can be sure that you have a correct copy of the key.</P

>A public and private key each have a specific role when
encrypting and decrypting documents.
A public key may be thought of as an open safe.
When a correspondent encrypts a document using a public
key, that document is put in the safe, the safe shut, and the
combination lock spun several times.
The corresponding private key is the combination that can 
reopen the safe and retrieve the document.
In other words, only the person who holds the private key
can recover a document encrypted using the associated public key.</P
><P
>The procedure for encrypting and decrypting documents is
straightforward with this mental model.
If you want to encrypt a message to Alice, you encrypt it
using Alice's public key, and she decrypts it with her private key.
If Alice wants to send you a message, she encrypts it using your
public key, and you decrypt it with your private key.</P
><P
>To encrypt a document the option 
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--encrypt</TT

You must have the public keys of the intended recipients.
The software expects the name of the document to encrypt as input; if
omitted, it reads standard input.
The encrypted result is placed on standard output or as specified using
the option <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--output</TT

The document is compressed for additional security in addition to
encrypting it.

the public key to which the document should be encrypted.
The encrypted document can only be decrypted by someone with a private
key that complements one of the recipients' public keys.
In particular, you cannot decrypt a document encrypted by you unless
you included your own public key in the recipient list.</P
><P
>To decrypt a message the option

></H1
><P
>A symmetric cipher is a cipher that uses the same key for both encryption
and decryption.
Two parties communicating using a symmetric cipher must agree on the
key beforehand.
Once they agree, the sender encrypts a message using the key, sends it
to the receiver, and the receiver decrypts the message using the key.
As an example, the German Enigma is a symmetric cipher, and daily keys
were distributed as code books.
Each day, a sending or receiving radio operator would consult his copy
of the code book to find the day's key.
Radio traffic for that day was then encrypted and decrypted using the
day's key.
Modern examples of symmetric ciphers include 3DES, Blowfish, and IDEA.</P
><P
>A good cipher puts all the security in the key and none in the algorithm.
In other words, it should be no help to an attacker if he knows which
cipher is being used.
Only if he obtains the key would knowledge of the algorithm be needed.
The ciphers used in GnuPG have this property.</P
><P
>Since all the security is in the key, then it is important that it be
very difficult to guess the key.
In other words, the set of possible keys, i.e., the <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>key
space</I
>, needs
to be large.
While at Los Alamos, Richard Feynman was famous for his ability to
crack safes.
To encourage the mystique he even carried around a set of tools
including an old stethoscope.
In reality, he used a variety of tricks to reduce the number of
combinations he had to try to a small number and then simply guessed
until he found the right combination.
In other words, he reduced the size of the key space.</P
><P
>Britain used machines to guess keys during World War 2.
The German Enigma had a very large key space, but the British built
specialized computing engines, the Bombes, to mechanically try 
keys until the day's key was found.
This meant that sometimes they found the day's key within hours of
the new key's use, but it also meant that on some days they never
did find the right key.
The Bombes were not general-purpose computers but were precursors
to modern-day computers.</P
><P
>Today, computers can guess keys very quickly, and this is why key
size is important in modern cryptosystems.
The cipher DES uses a 56-bit key, which means that there are
2<SUP
>56</SUP
> possible keys.
2<SUP
>56</SUP
> is 72,057,594,037,927,936 keys.
This is a lot of keys, but a general-purpose computer can check the
entire key space in a matter of days.
A specialized computer can check it in hours.
On the other hand, more recently designed ciphers such as 3DES, 
Blowfish, and IDEA
all use 128-bit keys, which means there are 2<SUP
>128</SUP
> 
possible keys.
This is many, many more keys, and even if all the computers on the
planet cooperated, it could still take more time than the age of
the universe to find the key.</P

>Public-key ciphers</A
></H1
><P
>The primary problem with symmetric ciphers is not their security but
with key exchange.
Once the sender and receiver have exchanged keys, that key can be
used to securely communicate, but what secure communication channel
was used to communicate the key itself?
In particular, it would probably be much easier for an attacker to work
to intercept the key than it is to try all the keys in the key space.
Another problem is the number of keys needed.
If there are <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>n</I
> people who need to communicate, then 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>n(n-1)/2</I
> keys
are needed for each pair of people to communicate privately.
This may be OK for a small number of people but quickly becomes unwieldy
for large groups of people.</P
><P
>Public-key ciphers were invented to avoid the key-exchange problem
entirely.
A public-key cipher uses a pair of keys for sending messages.
The two keys belong to the person receiving the message.
One key is a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>public key</I
> and may be given to anybody.
The other key is a <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>private key</I
> and is kept 
secret by the owner.
A sender encrypts a message using the public key and once encrypted,
only the private key may be used to decrypt it.</P
><P
>This protocol solves the key-exchange problem inherent with symmetric
ciphers.
There is no need for the sender and receiver to agree
upon a key.
All that is required is that some time before secret communication the
sender gets a copy of the receiver's public key.
Furthermore, the one public key can be used by anybody wishing to
communicate with the receiver.
So only <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>n</I
> keypairs are needed for <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>n</I
> 
people to communicate secretly
with one another.</P
><P
>Public-key ciphers are based on one-way trapdoor functions.
A one-way function is a function that is easy to compute,
but the inverse is hard to compute.
For example, it is easy to multiply two prime numbers together to get
a composite, but it is difficult to factor a composite into its prime
components.
A one-way trapdoor function is similar, but it has a trapdoor.
That is, if some piece of information is known, it becomes easy
to compute the inverse.
For example, if you have a number made of two prime factors, then knowing
one of the factors makes it easy to compute the second.
Given a public-key cipher based on prime factorization, the public
key contains a composite number made from two large prime factors, and
the encryption algorithm uses that composite to encrypt the
message.
The algorithm to decrypt the message requires knowing the prime factors,
so decryption is easy if you have the private key containing one of the
factors but extremely difficult if you do not have it.</P
><P
>As with good symmetric ciphers, with a good public-key cipher all of the
security rests with the key.
Therefore, key size is a measure of the system's security, but
one cannot compare the size of a symmetric cipher key and a public-key
cipher key as a measure of their relative security.
In a brute-force attack on a symmetric cipher with a key size of 80 bits,
the attacker must enumerate up to 2<SUP
>80</SUP
> keys to 
find the right key.
In a brute-force attack on a public-key cipher with a key size of 512 bits,
the attacker must factor a composite number encoded in 512 bits (up to
155 decimal digits).
The workload for the attacker is fundamentally different depending on
the cipher he is attacking.
While 128 bits is sufficient for symmetric ciphers, given today's factoring
technology public keys with 1024 bits are recommended for most purposes.</P

>Hybrid ciphers</A
></H1
><P
>Public-key ciphers are no panacea.
Many symmetric ciphers are stronger from a security standpoint,
and public-key encryption and decryption are more expensive than the
corresponding operations in symmetric systems.
Public-key ciphers are nevertheless an effective tool for distributing
symmetric cipher keys, and that is how they are used in hybrid cipher
systems.</P
><P
>A hybrid cipher uses both a symmetric cipher and a public-key cipher.
It works by using a public-key cipher to share a key for the symmetric
cipher.
The actual message being sent is then encrypted using the key and sent
to the recipient.
Since symmetric key sharing is secure, the symmetric key used is different
for each message sent.
Hence it is sometimes called a session key.</P
><P
>Both PGP and GnuPG use hybrid ciphers.
The session key, encrypted using the public-key cipher, and the message
being sent, encrypted with the symmetric cipher, are automatically
combined in one package.
The recipient uses his private-key to decrypt the session key and the
session key is then used to decrypt the message.</P
><P
>A hybrid cipher is no stronger than the public-key cipher or symmetric
cipher it uses, whichever is weaker.
In PGP and GnuPG, the public-key cipher is probably the weaker of
the pair.
Fortunately, however, if an attacker could decrypt a session key it
would only be useful for reading the one message encrypted with that
session key.
The attacker would have to start over and decrypt another session
key in order to read any other message.</P

>A document's digital signature is the result of applying a hash
function to the document.
To be useful, however, the hash function needs to satisfy two
important properties.
First, it should be hard to find two documents that hash to the
same value.
Second, given a hash value it should be hard to recover the document
that produced that value.</P
><P
>Some public-key ciphers<A
NAME="AEN230"
HREF="#FTN.AEN230"

> could be used to sign documents.
The signer encrypts the document with his <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>private</I
> key.
Anybody wishing to check the signature and see the document simply
uses the signer's public key to decrypt the document.
This algorithm does satisfy the two properties needed from a good hash
function, but in practice, this algorithm is too slow to be useful.</P
><P
>An alternative is to use hash functions designed to satisfy these
two important properties.
SHA and MD5 are examples of such algorithms.
Using such an algorithm, a document is signed by hashing it, and
the hash value is the signature.
Another person can check the signature by also hashing their copy of the
document and comparing the hash value they get with the hash value of
the original document.
If they match, it is almost certain that the documents are identical.</P
><P
>Of course, the problem now is using a hash function for digital
signatures without permitting an attacker to interfere with signature
checking.
If the document and signature are sent unencrypted, an attacker could
modify the document and generate a corresponding signature without the
recipient's knowledge.
If only the document is encrypted, an attacker could tamper with the
signature and cause a signature check to fail.
A third option is to use a hybrid public-key encryption to encrypt both
the signature and document.
The signer uses his private key, and anybody can use his public key
to check the signature and document.
This sounds good but is actually nonsense.
If this algorithm truly secured the document it would also
secure it from tampering and there would be no need for the signature.
The more serious problem, however, is that this does not protect either
the signature or document from tampering.
With this algorithm, only the session key for the symmetric cipher
is encrypted using the signer's private key.
Anybody can use the public key to recover the session key.
Therefore, it is straightforward for an attacker to recover the session
key and use it to encrypt substitute documents and signatures to send
to others in the sender's name.</P
><P
>An algorithm that does work is to use a public key algorithm to
encrypt only the signature.
In particular, the hash value is encrypted using the signer's private
key, and anybody can check the signature using the public key.
The signed document can be sent using any other encryption algorithm
including none if it is a public document.
If the document is modified the signature check will fail, but this
is precisely what the signature check is supposed to catch.
The Digital Signature Standard (DSA) is a public key signature 
algorithm that works as just described.
DSA is the primary signing algorithm used in GnuPG.</P

>Key tampering is a major security weakness with public-key cryptography.
An eavesdropper may tamper with a user's keyrings or forge a

For example, suppose Chloe wants to monitor the messages that Alice
sends to Blake.
She could mount what is called a <I

In this attack, Chloe creates a new public/private keypair.
She replaces Alice's copy of Blake's public key with the new public key.
She then intercepts the messages that Alice sends to Blake.
For each intercept, she decrypts it using the new private key, reencrypts
it using Blake's true public key, and forwards the reencrypted
message to Blake.
All messages sent from Alice to Blake can now be read by Chloe.</P

>Good key management is crucial in order to ensure not just the integrity

The core of key management in GnuPG is the notion of signing keys.
Key signing has two main purposes: it permits you to detect tampering
on your keyring, and it allows you to certify that a key truly belongs
to the person named by a user ID on the key.
Key signatures are also used in a scheme known as the <I

they are not shown by the GnuPG interface.</P

>Both new subkeys and new user IDs may be added to your keypair after
it has been created.
A user ID is added using the command
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>adduid</B
>.
You are prompted for a real name, email address, and comment just
as when you create an initial keypair.
A subkey is added using the command
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>addkey</B
>.
The interface is similar to the interface used when creating an initial
keypair.
The subkey may be a DSA signing key, and encrypt-only ElGamal
key, or a sign-and-encrypt ElGamal key.
When a subkey or user ID is generated it is self-signed using your
master signing key, which is why you must supply your passphrase
when the key is generated.</P
><P
>Additional user IDs are useful when you need multiple identities.
For example, you may have an identity for your job and an identity
for your work as a political activist.
Coworkers will know you by your work user ID.
Coactivists will know you by your activist user ID.
Since those groups of people may not overlap, though, each group
may not trust the other user ID.
Both user IDs are therefore necessary.</P
><P
>Additional subkeys are also useful.
The user IDs associated with your public master key are validated by
the people with whom you
communicate, and changing the master key therefore requires recertification.
This may be difficult and time consuming if you communicate with
many people.
On the other hand, it is good to periodically change encryption subkeys.
If a key is broken, all the data encrypted with that key will be
vulnerable.
By changing keys, however, only the data encrypted with the one broken
key will be revealed.</P
><P
>Subkeys and user IDs may also be deleted.
To delete a subkey or user ID you must first select it using the
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>key</B
> or
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>uid</B
> commands respectively.
These commands are toggles.
For example, the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>key <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>2</I
></TT
></B
>
selects the second subkey,
and invoking <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>key <TT
CLASS="PARAMETER"
><I
>2</I
></TT
></B
> again
deselects it.
If no extra argument is given, all subkeys or user IDs are deselected.
Once the user IDs to be deleted are selected, the command
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>deluid</B
>
actually deletes the user IDs from your key.
Similarly, the command <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>delkey</B
>
deletes all selected subkeys from both your public and private keys.</P
><P
>For local keyring management, deleting key components is a good way
to trim other people's public keys of unnecessary material.
Deleting user IDs and subkeys on your own key, however, is not always
wise since it complicates key distribution.
By default, when a user imports your updated public key it will be merged
with the old copy of your public key on his ring if it exists.
The components from both keys are combined in the merge, and this
effectively restores any components you deleted.
To properly update the key, the user must first delete the old version
of your key and then import the new version.
This puts an extra burden on the people with whom you communicate.
Furthermore, if you send your key to a keyserver, the merge will
happen regardless, and anybody who downloads your key from a keyserver
will never see your key with components deleted.
Consequently, for updating your own key it is better to revoke key
components instead of deleting them.</P

>In Chapter <A
HREF="#INTRO"
>1</A
> a procedure was given to validate your
correspondents' public keys: a correspondent's key is validated by
personally checking his key's fingerprint and then signing his public
key with your private key.
By personally checking the fingerprint you can be sure that the
key really does belong to him, and since you have signed they key, you
can be sure to detect any tampering with it in the future.
Unfortunately, this procedure is awkward when either you must validate
a large number of keys or communicate with people whom you do not
know personally.</P
><P
>GnuPG addresses this problem with a mechanism popularly known
as the <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>web of trust</I
>.
In the web of trust model, responsibility for validating public
keys is delegated to people you trust.
For example, suppose
<P
></P
><UL
COMPACT="COMPACT"
><LI
><P
>Alice has signed Blake's key, and</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Blake has signed Chloe's key and Dharma's key.</P
></LI
></UL
>

If Alice trusts Blake to properly validate keys that he signs, then
Alice can infer that Chloe's and Dharma's keys are valid without
having to personally check them.
She simply uses her validated copy of Blake's public key to
check that Blake's signatures on Chloe's and Dharma's are good.
In general, assuming that Alice fully trusts everybody to properly
validate keys they sign, then any key signed by a valid key is also
considered valid.
The root is Alice's key, which is axiomatically assumed to be valid.</P

CLASS="SECT2"
><HR><H2
CLASS="SECT2"
><A
NAME="AEN346"
>Trust in a key's owner</A
></H2
><P
>In practice trust is subjective.
For example, Blake's key is valid to Alice since she signed it, but she
may not trust Blake to properly validate keys that he signs.
In that case, she would not take Chloe's and Dharma's key as valid
based on Blake's signatures alone.
The web of trust model accounts for this by associating with each
public key on your keyring an indication of how much you trust the
key's owner.
There are four trust levels.

>Figure 3-1</A

The graph illustrates who has signed who's keys.
The table shows which keys Alice considers valid based on her
trust in the other members of the web.

This example assumes that two marginally-trusted keys or one
fully-trusted key is needed to validate another key.
The maximum path length is three.</P
><P
>When computing valid keys in the example, Blake and Dharma's are
always considered fully valid since they were signed directly
by Alice.
The validity of the other keys depends on trust.
In the first case, Dharma is trusted fully, which implies
that Chloe's and Francis's keys will be considered valid.
In the second example, Blake and Dharma are trusted marginally.
Since two marginally trusted keys are needed to fully validate a
key, Chloe's key will be considered fully valid, but Francis's
key will be considered only marginally valid.
In the case where Chloe and Dharma are marginally trusted,
Chloe's key will be marginally valid since Dharma's key is
fully valid.
Francis's key, however, will also be considered marginally
valid since only a fully valid key can be used to validate
other keys, and Dharma's key is the only fully valid key
that has been used to sign Francis's key.
When marginal trust in Blake is added, Chloe's key becomes
fully valid and can then be used to fully validate Francis's
key and marginally validate Elena's key.
Lastly, when Blake, Chloe, and Elena are fully trusted, this is
still insufficient to validate Geoff's key since the maximum
certification path is three, but the path length from Geoff
back to Alice is four.</P
><P
>The web of trust model is a flexible approach to the problem of safe
public key exchange.
It permits you to tune GnuPG to reflect how you use it.
At one extreme you may insist on multiple, short paths from your
key to another key <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>K</I
> in order to trust it.
On the other hand, you may be satisfied with longer paths and
perhaps as little as one path from your key to the other
key <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>K</I
>.
Requiring multiple, short paths is a strong guarantee
that <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>K</I
> belongs to whom your think it does.
The price, of course, is that it is more difficult to validate keys
since you must personally sign more keys than if you accepted fewer
and longer paths.</P

><P
>Ideally, you distribute your key by personally giving it to your
correspondents.
In practice, however, keys are often distributed by email or some
other electronic communication medium.
Distribution by email is good practice when you have only a few
correspondents, and even if you have many correspondents, you can use
an alternative means such as posting your public key on your World Wide
Web homepage.
This is unacceptable, however, if people who need your public key do
not know where to find it on the Web.</P
><P
>To solve this problem public key servers are used to collect
and distribute public keys.
A public key received by the server is either added to the server's
database or merged with the existing key if already present.
When a key request comes to the server, the server consults its
database and returns the requested public key if found.</P
><P
>A keyserver is also valuable when many people are frequently signing other
people's keys.
Without a keyserver, when Blake sign's Alice's key then Blake would send
Alice a copy of her public key signed by him so that Alice could
add the updated key to her ring as well as distribute it to all of her
correspondents.
Going through this effort fulfills Alice's and Blake's responsibility
to the community at large in building tight webs of trust and thus
improving the security of PGP.
It is nevertheless a nuisance if key signing is frequent.</P
><P
>Using a keyserver makes the process somewhat easier.
When Blake signs Alice's key he sends the signed key to the key server.
The key server adds Blake's signature to its copy of Alice's key.
Individuals interested in updating their copy of Alice's key then consult
the keyserver on their own initiative to retrieve the updated key.
Alice need never be involved with distribution and can retrieve signatures
on her key simply by querying a keyserver.&#13;</P
><P
>One or more keys may be sent to a keyserver using the command-line
option <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--send-keys</TT
>.
The option takes one or more key specifiers and sends the specified
keys to the key server.
The key server to which to send the keys is specified with the
command-line option <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--keyserver</TT
>.
Similarly, the option
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"

to retrieve keys from a keyserver, but the option <TT

There are several popular keyservers in use around the world.
The major keyservers synchronize themselves, so it is fine to
pick a keyserver close to you on the Internet and then use it
regularly for sending and receiving keys.</P

></H1
><P
>GnuPG is a complex tool with technical, social, and legal issues
surrounding it.
Technically, it has been designed to be used in situations having
drastically different security needs.
This complicates key management.
Socially, using GnuPG is not strictly a personal decision.
To use GnuPG effectively both parties communicating must use it.
Finally, as of 1999, laws regarding digital encryption, and in particular
whether or not using GnuPG is legal, vary from country to country and 
is currently being debated by many national governments.</P
><P
>This chapter addresses these issues.
It gives practical advice on how to use GnuPG to meet your security needs.
It also suggests ways to promote the use of GnuPG for secure
communication between yourself and your colleagues when your colleagues
are not currently using GnuPG.
Finally, the legal status of GnuPG is outlined given the current status
of encryption laws in the world.</P

>GnuPG is a tool you use to protect your privacy.
Your privacy is protected if you can correspond with others without
eavesdroppers reading those messages.</P
><P
>How you should use GnuPG depends on the determination and resourcefulness
of those who might want to read your encrypted messages.
An eavesdropper may be an unscrupulous system administrator casually
scanning your mail, it might be an industrial spy trying to collect
your company's secrets, or it might be a law enforcement agency trying
to prosecute you.
Using GnuPG to protect against casual eavesdropping is going to be
different than using GnuPG to protect against a determined adversary.
Your goal, ultimately, is to make it more expensive to recover the
unencrypted data than that data is worth.</P
><P

A well-chosen key size protects you against brute-force attacks on
encrypted messages.
Protecting your private key prevents an attacker from simply using your
private key to decrypt encrypted messages and sign messages in your name.
Correctly managing your web of trust prevents attackers from masquerading
as people with whom you communicate.
Ultimately, addressing these issues with respect to your own security
needs is how you balance the extra work required to use GnuPG with
the privacy it gives you.</P

>Choosing a key size</A
></H2
><P
>Selecting a key size depends on the key.
In OpenPGP, a public/private keypair usually has multiple keys.
At the least it has a master signing key, and it probably has one or
more additional subkeys for encryption.
Using default key generation parameters with GnuPG, the master
key will be a DSA key, and the subkeys will be ElGamal keys.</P
><P
>DSA allows a key size up to 1024 bits.
This is not especially good given today's factoring technology, but
that is what the standard specifies.
Without question, you should use 1024 bit DSA keys.</P
><P
>ElGamal keys, on the other hand, may be of any size.
Since GnuPG is a hybrid public-key system, the public key is used
to encrypt a 128-bit session key, and the private key is used to
decrypt it.
Key size nevertheless affects encryption and decryption speed
since the cost of these algorithms is exponential in the size of
the key.
Larger keys also take more time to generate and take more space
to store.
Ultimately, there are diminishing returns on the extra security
a large key provides you.
After all, if the key is large enough to resist a brute-force
attack, an eavesdropper will merely switch to some other method for
obtaining your plaintext data.
Examples of other methods include robbing your home or office
and mugging you.
1024 bits is thus the recommended key size.
If you genuinely need a larger key size then you probably already
know this and should be consulting an expert in data security.</P

>Protecting your private key</A
></H2
><P
>Protecting your private key is the most important job you have to
use GnuPG correctly.
If someone obtains your private key, then all data encrypted to
the private key can be decrypted and signatures can be made in your name.
If you lose your private key, then you will no longer be able to 
decrypt documents encrypted to you in the future or in the past,
and you will not be able to make signatures.
Losing sole possession of your private key is catastrophic.</P
><P
>Regardless of how you use GnuPG you should store the public
key's <A
HREF="#REVOCATION"
>revocation certificate</A
> 
and a backup of your private key on write-protected media in a safe place.
For example, you could burn them on a CD-ROM and store them in your
safe deposit box at the bank in a sealed envelope.
Alternatively, you could store them on a floppy and hide it in your
house.
Whatever you do, they should be put on media that is safe to store
for as long as you expect to keep the key, and you should store
them more carefully than the copy of your private key you use daily.</P
><P
>To help safeguard your key, GnuPG does not store your raw
private key on disk.
Instead it encrypts it using a symmetric encryption algorithm.
That is why you need a passphrase to access the key.
Thus there are two barriers an attacker must cross to access your private
key: (1) he must actually acquire the key, and (2) he must get past
the encryption.</P
><P
>Safely storing your private key is important, but there is a cost.
Ideally, you would keep the private key on a removable, write-protected disk
such as a floppy disk, and you would use it on a single-user machine 
not connected to a network.
This may be inconvenient or impossible for you to do.
For example, you may not own your own machine and must use a computer 
at work or school, or it may mean you have to physically disconnect
your computer from your cable modem every time you want to use GnuPG.</P
><P
>This does not mean you cannot or should not use GnuPG.
It means only that you have decided that the data you are protecting is
important enough to encrypt but not so important as to take extra
steps to make the first barrier stronger.
It is your choice.</P
><P
>A good passphrase is absolutely critical when using GnuPG.
Any attacker who gains access to your private key must bypass the 
encryption on the private key.
Instead of brute-force guessing the key, an attacker will almost
certainly instead try to guess the passphrase.</P
><P
>The motivation for trying passphrases is that most people choose
a passphrase that is easier to guess than a random 128-bit key.
If the passphrase is a word, it is much cheaper to try all the
words in the dictionaries of the world's languages.
Even if the word is permuted, e.g., k3wldood, it is still easier
to try dictionary words with a catalog of permutations.
The same problem applies to quotations.
In general, passphrases based on natural-language utterances
are poor passphrases since there is little randomness and lots
of redundancy in natural language.
You should avoid natural language passphrases if you can.</P
><P
>A good passphrase is one that you can remember but is hard for
someone to guess.
It should include characters from the whole range of printable characters
on your keyboard.
This includes uppercase alphabetics characters, numbers, and special
characters such as <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>}</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>|</TT
>.
Be creative and spend a little time considering your passphrase; a
good choice is important to ensure your privacy.</P

>Selecting expiration dates and using subkeys</A
></H2
><P
>By default, a DSA master signing key and an ElGamal encryption subkey 
are generated when you create a new keypair.
This is convenient, because the roles of the two keys are different,
and you may therefore want the keys to have different lifetimes.
The master signing key is used to make digital signatures, and it
also collects the signatures of others who have confirmed your
identity.
The encryption key is used only for decrypting encrypted documents
sent to you.
Typically, a digital signature has a long lifetime, e.g., forever, and
you also do not want to lose the signatures on your key that you worked
hard to collect.
On the other hand, the encryption subkey may be changed periodically
for extra security, since if an encryption key is broken, the
attacker can read all documents encrypted to that key both in the
future and from the past.</P
><P
>It is almost always the case that you will not want the master
key to expire.
There are two reasons why you may choose an expiration date.
First, you may intend for the key to have a limited lifetime.
For example, it is being used for an event such as a political campaign
and will no longer be useful after the campaign is over.
Another reason is that if you lose control of the key and do not have a
revocation certificate with which to revoke the key, having an expiration
date on the master key ensures that the key will eventually fall into
disuse.</P
><P
>Changing encryption subkeys is straightforward but can
be inconvenient.
If you generate a new keypair with an expiration date on the
subkey, that subkey will eventually expire.
Shortly before the expiration you will add a new subkey and
publish your updated public key.
Once the subkey expires, those who wish to correspond with you
must find your updated key since they will no longer be able
to encrypt to the expired key.
This may be inconvenient depending on how you distribute the key.
Fortunately, however, no extra signatures are necessary since
the new subkey will have been signed with your master signing
key, which presumably has already been validated by your
correspondents.</P
><P
>The inconvenience may or may not be worth the extra security.
Just as you can, an attacker can still read all documents encrypted to
an expired subkey.
Changing subkeys only protects future documents.
In order to read documents encrypted to the new subkey, the
attacker would need to mount a new attack using whatever
techniques he used against you the first time.</P
><P
>Finally, it only makes sense to have one valid encryption subkey on a
keyring.
There is no additional security gained by having two or more 
active subkeys.
There may of course be any number of expired keys on a keyring
so that documents encrypted in the past may still be decrypted,
but only one subkey needs to be active at any given time.</P

>Managing your web of trust</A
></H2
><P
>As with protecting your private key, managing your web of trust is
another aspect of using GnuPG that requires balancing security against
ease of use.
If you are using GnuPG to protect against casual eavesdropping and
forgeries then you can afford to be relatively trusting of other
people's signatures.
On the other hand, if you are concerned that there may be a determined
attacker interested in invading your privacy, then
you should be much less trusting of other signatures and spend more time 
personally verifying signatures.</P
><P
>Regardless of your own security needs, though, you should 
<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>always be careful</I
> when signing other keys.
It is selfish to sign a key with just enough confidence in the key's
validity to satisfy your own security needs.
Others, with more stringent security needs, may want to depend on 
your signature.
If they cannot depend on you then that weakens the web of trust
and makes it more difficult for all GnuPG users to communicate.
Use the same care in signing keys that you would like others to use when
you depend on their signatures.</P
><P
>In practice, managing your web of trust reduces to assigning trust to 
others and tuning the options 
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--marginals-needed</TT
>
and 
<TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--completes-needed</TT
>.
Any key you personally sign will be considered valid, but except for small
groups, it will not be practical to personally sign the key of every person
with whom you communicate.
You will therefore have to assign trust to others.</P
><P
>It is probably wise to be accurate when assigning trust and then
use the options to tune how careful GnuPG is with key validation.
As a concrete example, you may fully trust a few close friends that
you know are careful with key signing and then marginally
trust all others on your keyring.
From there, you may set <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--completes-needed</TT
> to
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="OPTION"
>--marginals-needed</TT
> to
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2</TT
>.
If you are more concerned with security you might choose values of
<TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>2</TT
>
and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>3</TT
> respectively.
If you are less concerned with privacy attacks and just want some
reasonable confidence about validity, set the values to <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1</TT
>
and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>1</TT
>.
In general, higher numbers for these options imply that more people
would be needed to conspire against you in order to have a key validated
that does not actually belong to the person whom you think it does.</P

>Building your web of trust</A
></H1
><P
>Wanting to use GnuPG yourself is not enough.
In order to use to communicate securely with others you must have
a web of trust.
At first glance, however, building a web of trust is a daunting task.
The people with whom you communicate need to use 
GnuPG<A
NAME="AEN557"
HREF="#FTN.AEN557"
>[5]</A
>, and there needs to be enough 
key signing so that keys can be considered valid.
These are not technical problems; they are social problems.
Nevertheless, you must overcome these problems if you want to 
use GnuPG.</P
><P
>When getting started using GnuPG it is important to realize that you
need not securely communicate with every one of your correspondents.
Start with a small circle of people, perhaps just yourself and
one or two others who also want to exercise their right
to privacy.
Generate your keys and sign each other's public keys.
This is your initial web of trust.
By doing this you will appreciate the value of a small, robust
web of trust and will be more cautious as you grow your web
in the future.</P
><P
>In addition to those in your initial web of trust, you may want to
communicate securely with others who are also using GnuPG.
Doing so, however, can be awkward for two reasons:
(1) you do not always know when someone uses or is willing to use
GnuPG, and (2) if you do know of someone who uses it, you may still have
trouble validating their key.
The first reason occurs because people do not always advertise that
they use GnuPG.
The way to change this behavior is to set the example and advertise 
that you use GnuPG.
There are at least three ways to do this: you can sign messages you mail
to others or post to message boards, you can put your public key on your
web page, or, if you put your key on a keyserver, you can put your key
ID in your email signature.
If you advertise your key then you make it that much more acceptable
for others to advertise their keys.
Furthermore, you make it easier for others to start communicating
with you securely since you have taken the initiative and made it clear
that you use GnuPG.</P
><P
>Key validation is more difficult.
If you do not personally know the person whose key you want to sign,
then it is not possible to sign the key yourself.
You must rely on the signatures of others and hope to find a chain
of signatures leading from the key in question back to your own.
To have any chance of finding a chain, you must take the initiative
and get your key signed by others outside of your initial web of trust.
An effective way to accomplish this is to participate in key
signing parties.
If you are going to a conference look ahead of time for a key
signing party, and if you do not see one being held, offer to 
<A
HREF="http://www.herrons.com/kb2nsx/keysign.html"
TARGET="_top"
>hold one</A
>.
You can also be more passive and carry your fingerprint with you
for impromptu key exchanges.
In such a situation the person to whom you gave the fingerprint
would verify it and sign your public key once he returned home.</P
><P
>Keep in mind, though, that this is optional.
You have no obligation to either publicly advertise your key or
sign other people's keys.
The power of GnuPG is that it is flexible enough to adapt to your
security needs whatever they may be.
The social reality, however, is that you will need to take the initiative
if you want to grow your web of trust and use GnuPG for as much of 
your communication as possible.</P

on NAI's PGP 5.0 user interface and came to the conclusion 
that novice users find PGP confusing and frustrating.
In their human factors study, only four out of twelve test subjects
managed to correctly send encrypted email to their team members, 
and three out of twelve emailed the secret without encryption. 
Furthermore, half of the test subjects had a technical background.</P
><P
>These results are not surprising.
PGP 5.0 has a nice user interface that is excellent if you already
understand how public-key encryption works and are familiar with
the web-of-trust key management model specified by OpenPGP.
Unfortunately, novice users understand neither public-key encryption
nor key management, and the user interface does little to help.</P
><P
>You should certainly read Whitten and Tygar's report if you are writing
a user interface.
It gives specific comments from each of the test subjects, and those
details are enlightening. 
For example, it would appear that many of subjects believed that a
message being sent to other people should be encrypted to the test
subject's own public key.
Consider it for a minute, and you will see that it is an easy mistake
to make.
In general, novice users have difficulty understanding the different
roles of the public key and private key when using GnuPG.
As a user interface designer, you should try to make it clear at 
all times when one of the two keys is being used.
You could also use wizards or other common GUI techniques for
guiding the user through common tasks, such as key generation, where
extra steps, such as generating a key revocation certification and 
making a backup, are all but essential for using GnuPG correctly.
Other comments from the paper include the following.

>The security of a networked computer is only as strong as its

></LI

><P
>For inexperienced users, simplify the display. 
Too much information hides the important information.
An initial display configuration could concentrate on giving
the user the correct model of the relationship between public 
and private keys and a clear understanding of the functions 
for acquiring and distributing keys.</P
></LI
></UL
></P
><P
>Designing an effective user interface for key management is even more
difficult.
The OpenPGP web-of-trust model is unfortunately quite obtuse.
For example, the specification imposes three arbitrary trust levels
onto the user: none, marginal, and complete.
All degrees of trust felt by the user must be fit into one of those
three cubbyholes.
The key validation algorithm is also difficult for non-computer scientists
to understand, particularly the notions of ``marginals needed'' and
``completes needed''.
Since the web-of-trust model is well-specified and cannot be changed,
you will have to do your best and design a user interface that helps
to clarify it for the user.
A definite improvement, for example, would be to generate a diagram of how
a key was validated when requested by the user.

>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more
    than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts,
    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to
    fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
    reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
    adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a
    machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
    state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
    location until at least one year after the last time you
    distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
    retailers) of that edition to the public.</P
