Subject: [PATCH] gitweb: support $projects_list_restrict

When git instaweb is started in a bare repository, it must still
set the $projects_list directory to the parent directory of the
bare project because gitweb cannot show the base $projects_list
directory as a repository even if it is one.

Unfortunately, if that parent directory contains a large number
of other bare (or non-bare) git repositories as subdirectories
then all of those will end up being scanned possibly resulting
in an enormous delay before showing the home gitweb page.

If $projects_list_restrict is set, the possible matches inside
the parent directory can be restricted to just the subdirectory
matching the bare repository in which git instaweb was originally
run.

This is much less surprising to the user than seeing all these
other repositories or taking an excessive amount of time to
display just the one repository.

Adding support for $projects_list_restrict  is only the first
step.  git-instaweb must also be enhanced to set
$projects_list_restrict when being run in a bare repository
in order to get the desired effect.
