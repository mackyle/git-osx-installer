Subject: [PATCH] passphrase.c: support launchd sockets

Make the trailing ":pid:protocol" part of GPG_AGENT_INFO
optional so that gpg-agent can be more easily started via
launchd.

Since launchd does not include the trailing ":pid:protocol"
part, such a setting in GPG_AGENT_INFO will not work without
this patch.

Note that a trailing ":pid:protocol" is still allowed in
GPG_AGENT_INFO and if it's present it undergoes the same
validation as it did without this patch.
