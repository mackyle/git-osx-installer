Subject: [PATCH] http-push: trim trailing newline from remote symref
Message-ID: <20150113022857.GA4087@peff.net>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Disposition: inline
Sender:	git-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <git.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List:	git@vger.kernel.org

When we fetch a symbolic ref file from the remote, we get
the whole string "ref: refs/heads/master\n", recognize it by
skipping past the "ref: ", and store the rest. We should
chomp the trailing newline.

This bug was introduced in ae021d8 (use skip_prefix to avoid
magic numbers, 2014-06-18), which did not notice that the
length computation fed to xmemdupz was quietly tweaked by 1
to account for this.

We can solve it by explicitly trimming the newline, which is
more obvious. Note that we use strbuf_rtrim here, which will
actually cut off any trailing whitespace, not just a single
newline. This is a good thing, though, as it makes our
parsing more liberal (and spaces are not valid in refnames
anyway).

This is a regression in v2.1.0.

It was causing t5540 to fail, but I realized I have been building with
NO_EXPAT for a while, so I didn't notice. Frankly, I'm kind of surprised
and disturbed that nobody noticed it before now. More evidence that we
can kill off dumb http-push? I would have thought somebody else would
have noticed the test failure, though.

I am embarrassed to have introduced the bug during a refactoring patch.
But in my defense, the original code was quite subtle and horrible, and
I think the end result at least is much obvious (and is a good point in
favor of skip_prefix's existence!). The original came from eecc836
(Another memory overrun in http-push.c, 2007-03-01). Looking at that
patch, I can't understand how the code before it ever worked in the
first place.
