Subject: [PATCH] pack-objects: turn off bitmaps when we split packs
Message-ID: <20141017011142.GA10462@peff.net>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Disposition: inline
Sender:	git-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <git.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List:	git@vger.kernel.org

If a pack.packSizeLimit is set, we may split the pack data
across multiple packfiles. This means we cannot generate
.bitmap files, as they require that all of the reachable
objects are in the same pack. We check that condition when
we are generating the list of objects to pack (and disable
bitmaps if we are not packing everything), but we forgot to
update it when we notice that we needed to split (which
doesn't happen until the actual write phase).

The resulting bitmaps are quite bogus (they mention entries
that do not exist in the pack!) and can cause a fetch or
push to send insufficient objects.

You should generally avoid splitting packs anyway, as it introduces
other inefficiencies, so I'm not really concerned about making bitmaps
work here (besides which, it would require a big change to the on-disk
format). The important thing here is avoiding creating the broken
bitmaps.
