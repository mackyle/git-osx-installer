Subject: [PATCH 2/2] sha1_file: fix iterating loose alternate objects
Message-ID: <20150209011538.GB21123@peff.net>

From: Jonathon Mah <me@jonathonmah.com>

The string in 'base' contains a path suffix to a specific object;
when its value is used, the suffix must either be filled (as in
stat_sha1_file, open_sha1_file, check_and_freshen_nonlocal) or
cleared (as in prepare_packed_git) to avoid junk at the end.

660c889e (sha1_file: add for_each iterators for loose and packed
objects, 2014-10-15) introduced loose_from_alt_odb(), but this did
neither and treated 'base' as a complete path to the "base" object
directory, instead of a pointer to the "base" of the full path
string.

The trailing path after 'base' is still initialized to NUL, hiding
the bug in some common cases.  Additionally the descendent
for_each_file_in_obj_subdir() function swallows ENOENT, so an error
only shows if the alternate's path was last filled with a valid
object (where statting /path/to/existing/00/0bjectfile/00 fails).

I think the S-O-B should still stand, as the code is now a mix of our
work, and the tests are still Jonathon's. But let me know if you do not
want your name attached to this. ;)

I am also happy to build it as a patch on top of the original if that is
simpler.
