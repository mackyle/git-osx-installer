Subject: [PATCH] t7810-grep: use test_expect_failure for undefined behavior

POSIX says \x has undefined behavior where x is any non-special
character such as a letter like 'x' or 'p'.

In 7675c7bd01b8 (t7810: avoid assumption about invalid regex syntax,
2017-01-11, v2.11.1), the problem of relying on "undefined behavior"
was corrected for "\x" but not for "\p".

Mark the remaining test that's likely to cause problems as
"test_expect_failure" since it relies on "undefined behavior" to
succeed.

A better solution would be along the same lines as 7675c7bd01b8
but this will do in a pinch.
