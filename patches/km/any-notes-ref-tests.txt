Subject: [PATCH] t/t3308-notes-merge.sh: succeed with relaxed notes refs

With the recent change to allow notes refs to be located in
the refs hierarchy in locations other than refs/notes/ the
'git notes merge refs/heads/master' test started succeeding.

Previously refs/heads/master would have been expanded to
a non-existing, ref refs/notes/refs/heads/master, and the
merge would have failed (as expected).

Now, however, since refs/heads/master exists and the new,
more relaxed notes refs rules leave it unchanged, the merge
succeeds.  This has a follow-on effect which makes the
next two tests fail as well.

The refs/heads/master ref could just be replaced with
another ref name that does not exist such as refs/heads/xmaster,
but there are already several tests using non-existant refs
so instead just remove the refs/heads/master line.
