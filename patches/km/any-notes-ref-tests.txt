Subject: [PATCH] t/t3308-notes-merge.sh: succeed with relaxed notes refs

With the recent change to allow notes refs to be located in
the refs hierarchy in locations other than refs/notes/ the
'git notes merge refs/heads/master' test started succeeding.

Previously refs/heads/master would have been expanded to
a non-existing, ref refs/notes/refs/heads/master, and the
merge would have failed (as expected).

Now, however, since refs/heads/master exists and the new,
more relaxed notes refs rules leave it unchanged, the merge
succeeds.  This has a follow-on effect which makes the
next two tests fail as well.

Replace refs/heads/master with refs/heads/xmaster (which
does not exist) in the merge test to restore the expected
failure and therefore also restore the passing state of the
following two tests.

Note that while the comments in this patch depend on
the "notes: accept any ref for merge" patch being previously
applied in order to make sense, the actual change does not.

If this patch is applied without the "accept any notes ref"
patch being applied, the tests will still succeed.

In other words, applying this patch before the other one
will NOT introduce any new test failures.
