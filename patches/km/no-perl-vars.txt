Subject: [PATCH] run-command.c: unset troublesome PERL env vars

Unset troublesome PERL environment variables before exec'ing
a sub-process.  In particular, PERL5LIB, PERLLIB, PERL5OPT and
PERLIO are unset.  This avoids, for example, having a PERL5LIB
variable set to libraries that would override and be incompatible
with the version of Perl the Git perl-based utilities were built
to use.

But don't do this if we're running the git svn subcommand as it
uses the perl found in the current PATH rather than the compile-
time perl.
