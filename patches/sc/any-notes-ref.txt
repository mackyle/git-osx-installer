Subject: [PATCH] notes: accept any ref for merge

Currently if you try to merge notes, the notes code ensures that the
reference is under the 'refs/notes' namespace. In order to do any sort
of collaborative workflow, this doesn't work well as you can't easily
have local notes refs seperate from remote notes refs.

This patch changes the expand_notes_ref function to check for simply a
leading refs/ instead of refs/notes to check if we're being passed an
expanded notes reference. This would allow us to set up
refs/remotes-notes or otherwise keep mergeable notes references outside
of what would be contained in the notes push refspec.
